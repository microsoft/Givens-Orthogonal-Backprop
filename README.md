# Givens Rotation Parametrized Orthogonal Backpropagation

Code for: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00003

Allows for gradient descent over rotational matrices. 

To setup the pytorch extension, go to the source folder (cpp for serial execution on gpu, cuda for parallel execution on gpu) and run 'python setup.py install'
An example NN layer is included in the GivensRotations.py files under the source folders.
